# What are classQueries?

classQueries are basically class-attributes that trigger DOM changes on the page.

## Structure

classQueries always consist of 4 parts.  
Each part is separated with an underscore \(\_\).

These are the different parts:

### 1st part - "cq"

An indicator that the class is a classQuery. Always "cq"!

### 2nd part - **EVENT**

The event that triggers the classQuery.  
Example: 'click'  
Look [here](https://github.com/Skayo/classQuery/tree/fbc9d95f287311cbc4828843fddc0f5b2aa75d99/Events/README.md) for more info!

### 3rd part - **ACTION**

The action that the classQuery fulfills.  
Example: 'hide'  
The action-part is special: It's the most important part of the classQuery, and therefore it needs arguments!  
Each argument is separated with a hyphen \(-\).  
Example: 'addClass-hidden' &lt;- Adds the class ".hidden"  
For more info about arguments and actions, look [here](https://github.com/Skayo/classQuery/tree/fbc9d95f287311cbc4828843fddc0f5b2aa75d99/Actions/README.md)!

### 4th part - **SELECTOR**

The element where the action happens.  
Example: 'id-veryImportantLink'  
Look [here](https://github.com/Skayo/classQuery/tree/fbc9d95f287311cbc4828843fddc0f5b2aa75d99/Selectors/README.md) for more info!

## Examples

* Hide an element on button click:

```html
<button class="cq_click_hide_id-example">Hide #example</button>

<p id="example">This element vanishes when you press the button above!</p>
```

- Add a class to an element when the finished loading:
```html
<p class="cq_init_hide_self">This element is never visible!</p>
```

* Smoothly scroll to different parts of the website:

```html
<a href="#" class="cq_click_scrollIntoView-smooth_id-introduction">Go to introduction</a>
<a href="#" class="cq_click_scrollIntoView-smooth_id-contact">Go to contact form</a>
<a href="#" class="cq_click_scrollIntoView-smooth_id-members">Go to members list</a>
 
<!-- Some other content ... -->
 
<div id="introduction">
  This is the introduction!
</div>

<div id="contact">
  This is a contact form.
</div>

<div class="members">
  This is a list with all members.
</div>
```
